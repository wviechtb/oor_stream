### 9.2: Prediction and uncertainty: predict, posterior_linpred, and posterior_predict

## Point prediction using predict

# note that coef() gives the median of the sampled values for the intercept
# and slope and we could use these values to make point predictions
coef(res)
tab

# so we can make a point prediction manually as follows
coef(res)[[1]] + coef(res)[[2]] * 2.0

# but this is not exactly what predict() does
x_new <- data.frame(growth=2.0)
y_point_pred <- predict(res, newdata=x_new)
y_point_pred

# predict() actually computes the predicted values based on all regression
# lines and then takes the mean of those values
mean(post[[1]] + post[[2]] * 2.0)

# careful: there is some inconsistent behavior of predict() when specifying
# 'newdata' versus when not specifying this; consider the first data point
head(dat, 1)

# predict(res) gives the predicted values of the given data, so the following
# gives the predicted value when growth = 2.4
predict(res)[1]

# this also gives the predicted value
predict(res, newdata=data.frame(growth=2.4))

# note that they are slightly different! this is because predict(res) uses the
# median coefficient values to compute the predicted value
coef(res)[[1]] + coef(res)[[2]] * 2.4

# but as noted above, when specifying 'newdata', predict() computes all
# predicted values (based on the various intercept and slope values) and then
# takes the mean; this is quite confusing/inconsisten behavior (although the
# difference is negligible here)

## Linear predictor with uncertainty using posterior_linpred or posterior_epred

# posterior_linpred() does the same thing as predict(), but gives the
# individual predictions (based on the various intercept and slope values)
y_linpred <- posterior_linpred(res, newdata=x_new)
head(y_linpred)

# taking their mean again gives the same value as predict(res, newdata=x_new)
mean(y_linpred[,1])

# note that posterior_linpred() does not show this inconsistent behavior when
# specifying 'newdata' versus not; so using posterior_linpred() is preferable
head(posterior_linpred(res, newdata=data.frame(growth=2.4)))
head(posterior_linpred(res)[,1,drop=FALSE])

# now we can now also visualize the posterior for the predicted value
plot(density(y_linpred[,1]))

# and compute other summary statistics
median(y_linpred[,1])
sd(y_linpred[,1])
mad(y_linpred[,1])

## Predictive distribution for a new observation using posterior_predict

# note that above, we are making a prediction for the mean of y when x = 2.0,
# but now we want to make a prediction for an individual election; we can do
# so with the posterior_predict() function
y_pred <- posterior_predict(res, newdata=x_new)
head(y_pred)

# so this yields the posterior distribution for the predicted value of y for
# an individual election, which we can again summarize in various ways
mean(y_pred[,1])
sd(y_pred[,1])
median(y_pred[,1])
mad(y_pred[,1])

# while the mean (or median) values are essentially the same for the predicted
# mean and the predicted value of an individual election, the uncertainty in
# predicting the result of an individual election is much larger

# note that running posterior_predict() multiple times yields different values
head(posterior_predict(res, newdata=x_new))
head(posterior_predict(res, newdata=x_new))

# visualize the posterior for the predicted value of an individual election
# and also add the posterior for the mean
plot(density(y_pred[,1]), col="dodgerblue", lwd=3, ylim=c(0,.40), main="", bty="l")
lines(density(y_linpred[,1]), col="firebrick", lwd=3)
legend("topright", inset=.02, lwd=3, col=c("firebrick", "dodgerblue"),
       legend=c("Posterior for E(y|x=2.0)", "Posterior for y|x=2.0"))

# do the prediction of y|x=2.0 manually
y_pred_manual <- post[[1]] + post[[2]] * 2.0 + rnorm(nrow(post), mean=0, sd=post[[3]])
head(y_pred_manual)

# also add the posterior based on our manual calculations
lines(density(y_pred_manual), col="forestgreen", lwd=3)

# we see that this is essentially identical to what posterior_predict() is
# doing, but because the additional uncertainly in predicting y is random,
# there are minor discrepancies

# we can derive further quantities from the posterior of the predicted value
# of y when x=2.0; for example, the posterior distribution for y being greater
# than 50% (which is of course a dichotomous variable)
table(y_pred[,1] > 50)

# and this distribution we can again summarize
mean(y_pred[,1] > 50)

# so the chances of winning the election is around 71% when x=2.0; this was in
# fact the economic growth value leading up to the 2016 presidential election
# when Hillary Clinton (as the incumbent candidate) ran against Donald Trump;
# according to the model, she had high chances of winning, but we all know how
# that one turned out ...

## Prediction given a range of input values

# predictions for x = -2.0, -1.5, ..., 4.0
new_grid <- data.frame(growth=seq(-2.0, 4.0, 0.5))
y_point_pred_grid <- predict(res, newdata=new_grid)
y_linpred_grid    <- posterior_linpred(res, newdata=new_grid)
y_pred_grid       <- posterior_predict(res, newdata=new_grid)

# examine the predicted values
y_point_pred_grid
head(y_linpred_grid)
head(y_pred_grid)

## Propagating uncertainty

# simulate the uncertainty in economic growth values (note: we use much more
# uncertainty here compared to the value in the book)
x_new <- rnorm(nrow(post), mean=2.0, sd=0.9)

# and make use of these in making a prediction of y
y_pred <- post[[1]] + post[[2]] * x_new + rnorm(nrow(post), mean=0, sd=post[[3]])

# show that this adds additional uncertainty to the posterior distribution
lines(density(y_pred), col="orange", lwd=3)

# note: we really have to bump of the SD for x_new to actually see this
# increase in uncertainty (with an SD of 0.3 as in the book, the difference is
# not really noticeable)

## Simulating uncertainty for the linear predictor and new observations

# instead of using the earnings dataset, we stick to the same dataset above
# and illustrate the part that is new, namely equations 9.1 and 9.2, which are
# used when fitting a model with lm()
res2 <- lm(vote ~ growth, data=dat)
summary(res2)

# we can make the two different types of predictions using predict()
x_new <- data.frame(growth=2.0)
predict(res2, newdata=x_new, interval="confidence") # this uses (9.1)
predict(res2, newdata=x_new, interval="prediction") # this uses (9.2)

# directly model the proportion of votes for the Democratic candidate as is
# done in the example above
res <- lm(y ~ 1, data=dat)
